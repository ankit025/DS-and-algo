/*
In computer science, a linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. 
It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.
The time complexity of the linear search algorithm is O(n). 

Steps
--> Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
--> If x matches with an element, return the index.
--> If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.
